Research Experience
======
* **Constructing a Drug Recommendation System for Traditional Chinese Medicine Prescriptions Using Machine Learning and Deep Learning Technologies**
  * PI: Yanchun Zhang
  * Software School of Fudan University
  * Project objective: Based on the actual prescription data of traditional Chinese medicine provided by the hospital, construct a recommendation system for prescription generation, with input as disease symptoms and output as relevant prescription drugs
  * Clean and organize the data of traditional Chinese medicine prescriptions and medical records provided by the hospital
  * Utilizing multi-label classification combined with cost-sensitive SVM method to construct a drug recommendation  system based on text data of traditional Chinese medicine prescriptions
  * Using the Transformer module proposed by Google and an end-to-end machine translation model, a traditional Chinese medicine prescription recommendation system is constructed using a question and answer system approach
