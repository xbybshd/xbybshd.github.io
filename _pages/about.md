I was graduated from Fudan university and I am a c++ programer in Kuaishou Technology. I am also applying for Phd now.

My intersts are about computational structural biology, but I also like learning the math, physics, chemistry, computer science.

If you want to know me better, you could browse my [cv](https://xbybshd.github.io/cv/).
