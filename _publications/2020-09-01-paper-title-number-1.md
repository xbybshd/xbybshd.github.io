excerpt: 'This paper is about the Traditional Chinese Medicine herb recommendation, which uses the machine learning algorithm. This paper uses Bayes Classifier Chain(multi-label classification) handle the correlation between the herbs and uses the Cost-Sensitive SVM process the Class imbalance problem of the training data. The results of experiments on the prescription dataset demonstrated the effectiveness and practicability of the proposed model for a prescription generation.'

This paper is about the Traditional Chinese Medicine herb recommendation, which uses the machine learning algorithm. This paper uses Bayes Classifier Chain(multi-label classification) handle the correlation between the herbs and uses the Cost-Sensitive SVM process the Class imbalance problem of the training data. The results of experiments on the prescription dataset demonstrated the effectiveness and practicability of the proposed model for a prescription generation.
